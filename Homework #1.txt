FROM customer c1
JOIN customer c2 ON c1.customer_street = c2.customer_street 
                AND c1.customer_city = c2.customer_city

sql

SELECT DISTINCT b.branch_name
FROM branch b

Q3

A. From the demand table, find the cumulative total sum for qty.

SELECT day, qty,
    SUM(qty) OVER (ORDER BY day) AS cumQty
FROM 
    demand;


B. Extract the two worst performing days of each product in terms of number of qty 
sold. Paraphrasing it: Get the days corresponding to the two minimum most 
values of qty for each product

SELECT product, day, qty, RN
FROM (
    SELECT 
        product,
        day,
        qty,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY qty ASC) AS RN
    FROM sales_data
) AS ranked_data
WHERE RN <= 2
ORDER BY product, RN;
